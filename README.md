# Project -> Hero

# Description :

During my second semester in computer science I felt like trying to program a game aside from a consle-based tic-tac-to. Here what I ended up making, it's not pretty and far from being optimised, but for a first game, I'm proud of it.
  
# What is it ? :

The game is simple, you, the Hero, have to kill monsters. By doing so you gather gold and can use this gold to upgrade your stats. Your gold can also be used to buy minions that can help you during your quest. Every monster killed will reward you and your minions (if you have any) with experience points. This experience will allow you and your team to gain levels, which will increase your stats.

# What are minions ? :

During your quest you can use your gold to buy 4 different types of minions :

 - Knight
 - Archer
 - Wizard
 - Miner
 
The knight and archer will simply deal damage over time. The wizard will sometimes attemp to increase you critical hit chance and the miner will passively generate gold. Plus, as you gain exp, you minions will also level up, which will either increase their attack damage (if they deal any) and their attack speed.

# Spells ? :

At first I was planning on adding spells into the game. My plan was to be able to spend gold everytime you wanted to activate a spell. Unfortunatly, back then, school took most of my time and I was unable to 'properly' finish the game.

# Goal behind the app :
  
As mentionned above, this game was mostly a fun experience for me, I wanted to see what I was able to do after one and a half semester. During the development of the game I ended up creating three different kind of monsters, and four minions, while this has nothing to do with programming, I did draw all the sprites myself!

But now, looking back, there is so much that could be improved, starting with the overuse of the browser's localStorage to store all the stats, as well as the layout not being flexible when it comes to the size of the window (resizing the window will littleraly mess-up the layout, but heh!). It ended up geing a fun little project which I am proud to share with everyone.
